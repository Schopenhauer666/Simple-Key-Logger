# SimplePythonKeylogger

## Description
This project is a simple keylogger created for **educational purposes only**. It demonstrates how keystrokes can be captured using Python. 

## Ethical Use
- This tool is designed for learning and should only be used on devices you own or have explicit permission to monitor.
- Misuse of this tool is illegal and unethical.

## How It Works
- Captures keystrokes and logs them to a file (`keylog.txt`).
- Stops logging when `ESC` is pressed.

## Setup
1. Install Python and `pynput`:
   pip install pynput
